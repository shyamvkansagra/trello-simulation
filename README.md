### About this project
This project was created using `create-react-app`. Once base React was setup, UI was designed and implemented.

After UI/UX is ready, next step was to add storage. Since this is frontend only application, have used local storage to save data. To mimic API functionality, local storage calls have been placed under folder called `api`.

Final step was to create a page to host the application. Used GitHub pages for that.
